Alexander Rhett Crammer
Full Sail University

This was written for Python
version 3.4.3 which was
installed on my Mac at the
beginning of this course.
I don't know how to downgrade
but I've read that it's backwards
compatible with 2.7.

middle_name = "Rhett"
last_name = "Crammer"

# Let's write those out
# print(first_name)

# response = input("What's your first name?\n") # raw_input() was renamed to input() in version 3.1 or so
# print("Hello, %s!" % response)

birth_year = 1995
current_year = 2015
year_difference = current_year - birth_year
# print("You should be around " + str(year_difference) + " years of age.")
